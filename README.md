# tcpanatomy
Low-level lightweight network monitoring tool.

TCPANATOMY is a low-level lightweight standalone tool allowing you to monitor and collect data about your network. Built with simplicity in mind. 
It does not require any third-party libraries like `pcap`. 

It is not a replacement of tcpdump but rather a tool meant to be used in situations where all you need is a quick look over the data flying through your network.

I decided to build the tool to get a bit more intimate with the TCP/IP stack and processing raw network data.
